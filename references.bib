abstract = {Maize, a vital global food crop, is susceptible to various diseases impacting agricultural yield and quality, necessitating effective monitoring strategies. This study presents a comprehensive approach utilizing advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for efficient maize leaf disease detection and classification. Leveraging datasets from Kaggle, Harvard Dataverse, and Mendeley, the proposed CNN maize disease detection (MDD) system integrates optimization techniques, data augmentation, batch size adjustments, and fine-tuning strategies. Evaluation through data splitting reveals significant correlations among maize leaf classifications and the influence of data augmentation on image quality. Following training, the CNN-MDD model is deployed on a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) simulation, achieving promising optimization parameters: latency of 7.60 ms, RAM size of 726.60 KB, classifier flash size of 344.70 KB, and an accuracy of 94.60 \%. These optimized parameters align well with MCU specifications, highlighting the potential for practical deployment on low-cost edge devices like Arduino Ble 33 Sense. Additionally, this research contributes to the creation of a Ghanaian maize crop pest and disease dataset and the development of an optimal and cost-effective CNN-MDD MCU edge device, aiming to provide local farmers in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa with a swift, offline solution for maize disease detection, thus fostering sustainable agricultural practices. We conduct a comparative analysis of Edge Impulse and TensorFlow, two prominent machine-learning platforms for TinyML model development and deployment in various applications, including smart crop disease detection. Utilizing a dataset comprising 12,344 raw images and 7,454 augmented images of healthy and diseased maize leaves, we evaluate the workflow, features, performance, and usability of each platform. Our findings indicate that Edge Impulse holds a slight advantage over TensorFlow in terms of ease of use, reliability, and memory footprint, whereas TensorFlow offers greater flexibility, customization options, and higher accuracy. We conclude that while both platforms are suitable for crop disease detection, a combined approach allows for leveraging TensorFlow's robust training capabilities for complex neural networks alongside the simplicity of Edge Impulse for deploying models on low-powered edge devices. This synergistic approach enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of crop disease detection systems, ultimately benefiting agricultural practices and food security.}

abstract = {In the uncertainties within which the worldwide food security lies nowadays, the agricultural industry is raising a crucial need for being equipped with the state-of-the-art technologies for a more efficient, climate-resilient and sustainable production. The traditional production methods have to be revisited, and opportunities should be given for the innovative solutions henceforth brought by big data analytics, cloud computing and internet of things (IoT). In this context, we develop an optimized tinyML-oriented model for an active machine learning-based greenhouse microclimate management to be integrated in an on-field microcontroller. We design an experimental strawberry greenhouse from which we collect multivariate climate data through installed sensors. The obtained values' combinations are labeled according to a five-action multi-label control strategy, then used to prepare a machine learning-ready dataset. The dataset is used to train and five-fold cross-validate 90 Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with varied hyperparameters to select the most performant –yet optimized– model instance for the addressed task. Our multi-label control approach enables designing highly scalable models with reduced computational complexity, comprising only n control neurons instead of (1 + ∑nk=1Cnk) neurons (usually generated from a classic single-label approach from n input variables). Our final selected model incorporates 2 hidden layers with 7 and 8 neurons respectively and 151 parameters; it scored a mean accuracy of 97\% during the cross-validation phase, then 96\% on our supplementary test set. The model enables an intelligent and autonomous greenhouse management with the less required computations. It can be efficiently deployed in microcontrollers within real world operating conditions.}
