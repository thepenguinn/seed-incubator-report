\chapter{EMCU: Overview} \label{chp:}

As the name suggests, the \textsc{Environment Monitoring and Control Unit} is responsible
for taking care of the environmental
aspects of the incubator. EMCU aims to monitor and control aspects like the
\emph{temperature}, \emph{humidity}, \emph{lighting}, \emph{air quality}, etc.

As we can see from figure \ref{fig:abstractEMCU}, \textsc{Emcu} needs to
\emph{interface} with various systems that have various \emph{actuators} and \emph{sensors}. As a matter of
fact, the sheer amount of \emph{actuators} and \emph{sensors} required to
achieve this exceeds the total number of GPIOs\footnote{General Purpose Input
Output pins.} \esp has. In order to \emph{synchronize} all of the
\emph{subsystems}, \esp needs an \emph{external subsystem} to control all the
other \emph{subsystems}, an \textsc{Auxiliary System} as we will be calling
this \emph{external system}, in this entire document. To know more about auxiliary
system, jump right to chapter \ref{chp:auxiliarySystem}.

Along with this, EMCU interfaces with GMU for accomplishing various tasks. And SINC
app helps the user to control and monitor most of the aspects of EMCU.
