\chapter{Auxiliary System} \label{chp:auxiliarySystem}

Now let's tackle the \emph{pin problem} of \esp. Due to
the sheer amount of pins required to \emph{sense} and \emph{actuate} different
parts of the \emph{incubator}, we need a \emph{system} that intermediates this
task. Thus the \emph{birth} of \emph{Auxiliary system}.

The sensory systems is mediated by two set of \emph{Analog multiplexers} which are
\emph{serially} addressable\footnote{right now only one set is implemented.}. And the
actuator systems are mediated by \emph{shift register} boards. Following sections will
take a deep dive into the design of each of these systems.

As we can see from figure \ref{fig:emcuAuxilarySystem}, the sensors
and actuators are mediated by three types of boards, namely \textsc{Multiplexer Boards},
\textsc{Relay Boards}, and \textsc{Main Boards}. Right now only one of the multiplexer board,
and two of the relay boards are finished. This chapter goes through the design of those
two types of boards. The main boards are similar to relay boards, but they are using a
different type of shift register.
