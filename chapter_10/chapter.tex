\chapter{Auxiliary System} \label{chp:auxiliarySystem}

First thing we are going to tackle is the \emph{pin problem} of \esp. Due to
the sheer amount of pins required to \emph{sense} and \emph{actuate} different
parts of the \emph{incubator}, we need a \emph{system} that intermediates this
task. Thus the \emph{birth} of \emph{Auxiliary system}.

The sensory systems is mediated by two set of \emph{Analog multiplexers} which are
\emph{serially} addressable\footnote{right now only one set is implemented.}. And the
actuator systems are mediated by \emph{Shift registers}. Following sections will
take a deep dive into the design of each of these systems.
