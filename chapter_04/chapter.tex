\chapter{Enclosure of the Incubator} \label{chp:}

The enclosure of the frame houses the seedling and all the other components. So it
is important for it to be well build. The structural frame needs to be strong,
the incubator area needs to be isolated and the electronics circuits should be
housed safely. This chapter goes through how we are going to achieve such an enclosure
for the incubator.
